In multimodal AI systems, modular coordination defines how inputs stay synchronized.  
For OM1, this means aligning ASR (speech recognition), TTS (speech generation), and VLM (visual reasoning) into one continuous logic flow.  
Without this alignment, human-robot interaction feels fragmented and less intuitive.

**Connection**  
OM1 builds a coordination layer where each module negotiates context before acting.  
When speech and vision modules share semantic buffers, latency drops and the agent behaves with more intent.  
This modular design allows developers to update one component (for instance, TTS) while keeping overall synchronization intact — flexible, yet consistent.

**Insight**  
OM1’s strength lies in translating human-like intuition into a modular framework.  
By modeling reasoning as a sequence of micro-decisions, it gives autonomy without disorder.  
In future iterations, OM1 could serve as a reference layer for any AI or robotics runtime that pursues adaptive coordination.
