In multimodal AI systems, modular coordination defines how inputs are synchronized.
For OM1, this means aligning ASR (speech recognition), TTS (speech generation), and VLM (visual reasoning) under one logic flow.
Without this synchronization, human-robot interaction becomes fragmented and unnatural.

## Connection

OM1 establishes a coordination layer that allows each module to “negotiate” context before acting.
When speech and vision modules share semantic buffers, timing delays drop and the agent feels more intentional.
This design enables developers to update one module (like TTS) without disrupting the others — a flexible yet consistent structure.

## Insight

OM1’s real strength is its ability to translate human-like intuition into modular structure.
By modeling reasoning as a sequence of micro-decisions, it gives autonomy without chaos.
In future releases, OM1 could become a reference layer for any robotics or AI runtime that aims for adaptive coordination.
